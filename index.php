                Jane Werner's 34 years of museum experience includes 26 years at The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh where she served as Program Director, Deputy Director and currently Executive Director.  Werner leads the team responsible for all aspects of the Museum's mission and vision, exhibits, public programming, funding and operations. The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh expanded in November 2004 after the completion of a $29M capital campaign.  Attendance grew from 80,000 to currently 300,000. The project was the recipient of the 2006 American Institute of Architects National Award and National Trust for Historic Preservation Award. The Museum received the 2009 National Medal from the Institute of Museum and Library Services for its work in the community and in 2011 the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh was named one of the top ten children's museums by Parents Magazine. Under Werner's leadership and in partnership with the Warhol Museum, the Children's Museum reopened the closed New Hazlett Theater, raising over $2million and creating a separate 501c3 organization. In 2013, the museum was cited by AAM Press in the book <u>Magnetic</u> as one of six museums <i>with powerful internal alignment and a compelling vision allowing it to attract the critical resources for success</i>.

In 2010 she received the Jan Hawkins Award for Early Career Contributions to Humanistic Research and Scholarship in Learning Technologies for her research on how filmmaking serves as a vehicle for positive identity development and sophisticated literacy learning for young people who are disaffiliated from school. Halverson co-directs with Kimberly Sheridan the Learning in the Making research lab, where they are currently focused on what and how young people learn through making and how new technologies can be leveraged for more inspired and engaged making processes.
